Had two methods for solving this problem.

One is generalisation of https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/311743/quantum-circuit-for-a-3-qubit-w-state to N qubits

Second method only uses H, X and controls. Pretty sure this is the intended solution.
Doesn't use G (Rotations around y)

Ended up implementing Method 1 for my solution because seemed easier.
Method 2 would actually be quite easy using some library methods:
eg: BoolArrFromPositiveInt, ControlledOnBitString
