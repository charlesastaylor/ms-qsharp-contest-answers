This folder contains the Q# code of the tester for quantum classification problems from 
[Microsoft Q# Coding Contest - Summer 2020](https://codeforces.com/contest/1357/).

To use it, you need to add a classical driver (in Python or Q#) that would read the data and pass it to the Q# operation `TestOperation`.
